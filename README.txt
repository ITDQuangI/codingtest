This file will describe how to run a script.

1) First, code was written in python language so you need to install python interpreter before you run it
- For Window user, you can go to https://www.python.org to download and install the interpreter
- For Mac, Linux user you can go to the internet and search how to install the interpreter by command line interface


2) After install the python interpreter, you can run my script following the rule:

[ python run.py <question_id> <question_id> ]

	+ for example, if you want to see results of question 3 and 4, you should try: python run.py 3 4

	+ for example, if you want to see result of question 1, you should try: python run.py 1

In this code, you will only have 4 valid question_id from 1 to 4 (or from -4 to -1 in the reverse order)
Note: I use python 3.7.5 to write the code so it will be better if you use the 3.7.5 python interpreter
